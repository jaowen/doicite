Largely based on two questions/answers from Stack Exchange:

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/6848/automatically-dereference-doi-to-bib
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9403661/how-can-i-specify-content-type-accepted-when-requesting-a-http-resource-with-rub/940386

The key line of code (in my python script) that actually makes the online request for the BibTeX citation, was posted by user Stian Håklev on StackOverflow.
